# Project Description
This project is made for educational purposes, I wanted to get involved in making a game in python to know that I can learn and overcome personal challenges, it is made with python and using pygame as a library. This game pretends to be a 2D simulator of metropolitan trains.

**Warning**: The simulation is not 100% to the real one, but I will try to inform myself and I appreciate comments that allow me to improve functionalities so that it resembles it as much as possible

# Getting Started

In this section I will explain how to install the requirements and be able to start the game

## Prerequisites

We will need to install Python 3 and Pygame(library)

* Python 3: In the case of windows we will find it in the Microsoft Store it is simply to install it, but on Ubuntu it requires this command in Terminal.

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3.6
    ```
* Now we need Pygame, we open a terminal and install it with:
    ```sh
    pip install -U pygame --user
    ```

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/evermine18/TrainGame.git
    ```
2. Enter the folder where the project is
3. Start ir with:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

# MINIMAL TODO

- [ ] Engine phisics
- [ ] Add UI to the game with main menu
- [ ] More map editor tools
- [ ] Possible multiplayer
- [x] Basic sprite rendering
- [x] Sprite rendering with png
- [x] Update sprite position
- [x] Engine that is responsible for updating the position of each object
- [x] Keyboard events
- [x] Mapping tool and map load system
- [x] Camera System
- [x] Render Optimizations
- [x] Works with any resolution
